There is lots of division about when it is officially Christmastime. This project is my attempt at having an answer. (but also just something fun I thought I could work on) Originally this was inspired by the much simplier website [isitchristmas.com](https://isitchristmas.com).

If you dive into the commit history of this project, you'll see lots of random things going on. This is my first time building my own project from the ground up. So there's a lot of testing and experimenting as I try to figure out things like Cloudflare worker functions and setting up my own Vue project.

This project is being built in TypeScript and the Vue framework. It is being hosted on Cloudflare using their integration with GitHub. The "backend" is all serverless Cloudflare Worker Functions.

I have my own thoughts about when the Christmas Season starts. Personally I like to start listening to Christmas music and celebrating beginning November 1st. But the more I read into the history, the more it seems like the only authoritative stance one can take is to agree with the Catholics. Meaning it starts 4 Sundays before Christmas (the start of advent) and ends on January 6th (Epiphany, the day after the 12 days of Christmas). Part of this project is a research project, and will show the different ways to define when Christmastime Starts.
